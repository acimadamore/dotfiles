# Andr√©s' dotfiles

Work in progress.

## Requirements

I use [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage my Vim's plugins, so install it if you want to use this vimrc.

### Optional

- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) cat replacement. Used as default pager instead of less.
- [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). Nice ack replacement and used for fuzzy searches in vim.
- Exuberant ctags for vim completion.

## Install

No install script yet. Symlink everything lol.
