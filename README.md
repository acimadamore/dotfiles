# :zap: Andres' dotfiles

My dotfiles. These are simple configuration files that should work on any *nix system, but some parts are Ubuntu/Debian exclusive which is what i use. Feel free to explore and copy parts for your own dotfiles.

To install these dotfiles (or any other) you can use my [dotfiles](https://github.com/acimadamore/ansible-role-dotfiles) Ansible role. Also check out my [workstation](https://github.com/acimadamore/workstation) project for provisioning my workstations!
