# Andres' dotfiles

## Setup

Clone this project:

    git clone git://github.com/acimadamore/dotfiles.git

In the project folder:

    ./setup.sh

This script installs the necessary packages, the dotfiles and upgrades the system. Before the dotfiles are installed, the current files are backed up in a tar.gz file inside the project's folder. Check out ["What's in it?"](#whats-in-it) section for a complete list of the installed packages.

:warning: **Warning!** for now this only works with Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic using KDE desktop environment(and derived)! hopefully this will change soon.
